# Industrial Visit to Daikin Industries – ERD Project  

## About the Project  
As part of our industrial visit to Daikin Industries, we explored how the company manages its operations and data flow. The goal of this project was to design a clear and structured Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visualizes key business processes such as:  

- Order Processing  
- Inventory Management  
- Customer Engagement  
- Supplier Coordination  

By mapping these relationships, we aimed to understand Daikin’s operational efficiency and how structured data management can improve decision-making.  

## Project Objectives  
- Create a well-defined ERD to represent Daikin’s business processes.  
- Identify key data relationships that impact operations.  
- Help optimize workflows by visualizing data movement.  
- Ensure scalability for future business growth and expansion.  

## ERD Breakdown – The Key Entities  
Here’s what our ERD covers:  

- *Employee* – Stores employee details such as ID, name, and role to define responsibilities.  
- *Customer* – Maintains customer information to ensure smooth order processing and communication.  
- *Order* – Represents transactions, linking customers to their purchases and processing schedules.  
- *Order Details* – Captures specific product information within each order for better traceability.  
- *Product* – Contains details about available items, helping in inventory categorization.  
- *Supplier* – Stores supplier profiles to streamline procurement and stock management.  
- *Inventory* – Monitors stock levels to support efficient warehouse management.  
- *Service Request* – Connects customers to after-sales support and maintenance.  

The ERD includes one-to-many (1:M) and many-to-many (M:N) relationships, accurately reflecting how Daikin’s business functions operate.  

## Observations  
- *Streamlined Order Processing* – Tracks the entire journey from order placement to fulfillment efficiently.  
- *Effective Inventory Management* – Prevents shortages and overstocking through real-time stock tracking.  
- *Improved Supplier Coordination* – Ensures smooth procurement and stock replenishment.  
- *Better Employee Management* – Assigns roles and responsibilities clearly.  
- *Customer-Centric Service* – Strengthens after-sales support with structured service request handling.  

## Key Insights and Recommendations  
- *Automated Order Tracking* – Reduces delays and minimizes errors in order fulfillment.  
- *Live Inventory Monitoring* – Improves inventory control with real-time stock updates.  
- *Supplier Collaboration* – Strengthens partnerships for better procurement and supply chain management.  
- *Data Accuracy and Reliability* – Implements validation rules to enhance data integrity.  
- *Scalability for Growth* – Allows future expansion across different business functions.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides a structured approach to understanding Daikin’s business operations through an Entity-Relationship Diagram. The insights gained contribute to process improvement, better data management, and enhanced decision-making within the company.
